***These are simple applications of the MVC model.***
- The first exercice was an evaluated tutorial class where I had to draw a case diagram, a classes diagram and some sequence diagrams based on my observation of an application. 
- The second assignment was divided in two exercices, the first to create an MVC application based on some provided code to show the temperature on three views
but with the same model, two with text fields containing respectively the temperature in Celius and in Farenheit, and the third consisting of a control bar with the temperature in Celsius. The three views are connected and the user can change the temperature on whichever vue he chooses, it will automatically be updated on the others.
- The second exercice was based on the same model, MVC. The goal was to generate two connected views where one would contain the height and width of a rectangle, the latter would be drawn on the second view.
